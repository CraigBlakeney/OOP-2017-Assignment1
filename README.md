This Assignment is based on a Spaceship HUD. It includes a control panel on the bottom of the screen and a view of space on the top part of the screen. The stars are stored in an array list and the planets are generated from a CSV file. The box in the bottom left corner of the screen lets you change the colour of the control panel by selecting a colour. Also the info box to the right displays the info of each planet when you hover the mouse over each planet. There is also a radar in the bottom right corner of the screen that shows the positioning of the planets.
I am proud of the use of the CSV file to load the planets and the use of the mouse positioning to display information about that planet.
